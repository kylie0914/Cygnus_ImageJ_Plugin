# Cygnus ImageJ Plugin - Multi-Image Alignment Code
 We have developed a suite of ImageJ plugins to facilitate the analysis of cyclic EV images. These plug
ins perform background subtraction, multi-image alignment, image stacking, and particle detection (see 
Supplementary Movie 1). The processes allow researchers to transform their raw data into a clean, 
unified dataset ready for further analysis (e.g., Cygnus). The plugins are available for download at 
https://The plugins are available for download.

## Overall workflow
Users should specify the directory containing raw input images (TIF format) and follow on-screen 
prompts during interactive steps. The plugins automatically generate dedicated output directories for 
processed results, maintaining an organized data architecture throughout the analysis pipeline. The 
following sequential steps are performed:
