# Cygnus ImageJ Plugin - Multi-Image Alignment Code 
 We have developed a suite of ImageJ plugins to facilitate the analysis of cyclic EV images. These plug
ins perform background subtraction, multi-image alignment, image stacking, and particle detection (see 
Supplementary Movie 1). The processes allow researchers to transform their raw data into a clean, 
unified dataset ready for further analysis (e.g., Cygnus).

## Overall workflow
Users should specify the directory containing raw input images (TIF format) and follow on-screen 
prompts during interactive steps. The plugins automatically generate dedicated output directories for 
processed results, maintaining an organized data architecture throughout the analysis pipeline. The 
following sequential steps are performed:

### Background Subtraction : CBD_iter_SubBG.ijm 
This plugin enhances the signal contrast by removing background signals from fluorescence images 
using a rolling ball algorithm.

**Function**
It iteratively processes all .tif images in the input folder, applies background subtraction with a 50-pixel 
rolling radius, and saves the cleaned images in a BackgroundSubtracted directory

**Usage**
 Users specify a folder containing raw .tif images, and the plugin outputs background-subtracted 
images in a designated subfolder.

### Image Alignment : CBD_Drawline_images.ijm 
 This plugin allows users to define alignment markers (Fig. N1) by drawing reference lines on 
fluorescence images.

**Function**
 The plugin sequentially loads images from the input folder. The user draws a straight line connecting 
two fluorescence markers on the first image, and the plugin replicates this line on subsequent images. 
The updated images are saved in an output directory.

**Usage**
 Users input a folder with raw .tif images, and the plugin outputs images with alignment lines. Interaction 
is required to draw the initial alignment line.

### Image stacking : CBD_Stack_images.ijm 
 This plugin aligns and stacks fluorescence images (Fig. N2) to create a unified dataset for analysis.

<img width="636" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80396900-61ee-4c4c-b580-705509e0c357" />

**Function**
It aligns each image to a reference image using predefined alignment lines, stacks the aligned images 
into a hyperstack, and corrects for channel misalignment if necessary. The final stacked image is saved 
as a .tif file.

**Usage**
Input is a folder containing images with alignment lines, and output is a single .tif file containing the 
stacked images. Adjustable parameters include the reference channel (default: 1) and the number of 
channels (default: 12).


### Particle detection and colocalization : CBD_ComDet_Auto.ijm 
This plugin automates particle detection and colocalization analysis in stacked images.

<img width="250" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44a4eb96-e4ab-4b4e-a951-005dd982d51b" />

**Function**
 It detects particles based on user-defined parameters (e.g., particle size, intensity threshold, and maximum distance for 
colocalization), outputs results as CSV files, and saves annotated images and analysis results

**Usage**
 Input is a stacked .tif image, and output includes detection results in CSV format and processed images. Parameters 
include particle size (default: 3.00 pixels), intensity threshold (default: 5.00 SD), and maximum colocalization distance 
(default: 4.00 pixels).
